Readmo

NaNoWriMo is coming up, and I wanted a nice way to let my family and friends read my progress.

I looked at Deviant Art and a few other writing sites and none of them seemed well set up to handle a 50k novella, and I was thinking at the same time that I didn't really want any of the functionality they offered: I don't want comments, or the ability to update live - I just want to be able to put my work online and make it nice and readable.

Readmo is an attempt to do that and nothing else. You put pages in the pages directory (alphabetical order is all I ask) and then Readmo shows you them. That's it.
